Bus Times is a small app intended to display live Bus Time information, with support for displaying the results on a smartwatch.

It is currently focused on the UK (with initial support for London), and only the MetaWatch is supported.

To do:
* Finish initial implementation (select preferred stops, use GPS to locate closest preferred stop, remove dead code)
* Add support for more smart watches (Sony Livewatch, Sony Smartwatch, Pebble, etc)
* Add more sources of bus times, and a map view showing which areas of the country are covered
* Performance optimisations (currently it takes several hours to convert all TFL [London] bus coordinates from OSG to Lat/Long)
* Spit/Polish
