Bus Times is a small app intended to display live Bus Time information, with support for displaying the results on a smartwatch.

It is currently focused on the UK (with initial support for London), and only the MetaWatch is supported.

Note: This project now relies on the AndroidUtils project (also by me, also hosted on GitHub) for a number of common MetaWatch related interfaces, definitions, etc, and for the LocationTracker utility class that wraps up a lot of crufty GPS code

To do:
* Finish initial implementation (use GPS to locate closest preferred stop)
* Make it look pretty
* Add support for more smart watches (Sony Livewatch, Sony Smartwatch, Pebble, etc)
* Add more sources of bus times, and a map view showing which areas of the country are covered
* Spit/Polish
